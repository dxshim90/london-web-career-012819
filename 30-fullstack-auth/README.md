# Fullstack Authentication

What is Auth?

Authentication - Checking to see that you are who you say you are (sign in with your username and password)

- Major pieces
  - BCrypt for passwords
  - Conditional logic in backend to send appropriate API responses
  - Conditional logic in frontend to handle responses
  - React-router for client-side routing (moving users to appropriate pages after login/signup)

Authorization - What are you allowed to do, and who are you allowed to do it for?
