# Higher Order Components

- [ ] What is a HOC?
- [ ] How do we use them?


- What does it mean for something to be higher order?

- Functions as first-class citizen
  ```
     First-class citizenship, within the world of programming, means that a given entity (such as a function) supports all the operational properties inherent to other entities; properties such as being able to be assigned to a variable, passed around as a function argument, returned from a function, etc. Basically, first-class citizenship simply means “being able to do what everyone else can do.”
  ```

- This gives rise to the idea of higher-order functions
- Higher-order functions
  - Is a function that outputs/returns a function and/or receive functions as arguments.
  - Common HOFs
    - `map` 
    - `forEach`
    - `addEventListener`
    - `setInterval`
    - `setTimeout`
    - `bind`
    - `call`/`apply`

- Okay, so what then is an HOC?
  - It is a component that takes a component and renders it, and add functionality to that component
